    "Place the answer to your code only in the area specified. Also, make sure to run all your code (e.g., if you are running the code on your local machine, press >> to \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells\"). This should plot all outputs including your answers to homework questions. After this, go to file (top left) and select \"Print\". Save your file as a PDF and upload the PDF to Canvas. This is one way to generate a PDF. You can also search for other methods to generate a PDF from Jupyter."
